# Wordle Game in Python ðŸŽ®
Welcome to the Python implementation of the popular word puzzle game Wordle! This repository contains a simple, text-based version of the game, where players have six attempts to guess a secret five-letter word. With each guess, the game provides feedback on which letters are correct and whether they are in the correct position.
This game uses very basic features of python as it is the first game I developed.

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Enter guesses and receive real-time feedback on your accuracy.
Color-Coded Hints: Letters in the correct position are marked, helping you to narrow down the word.
Word List: A predefined list of valid five-letter words.
Random Word Generation: Each game starts with a randomly selected word, ensuring a unique experience every time.
Endgame Summary: After each game, receive a summary of your performance, including the correct word and number of attempts.

How to Play
Enter a five-letter word as your guess.
The game will give you feedback on your guess:
A correct letter in the correct position will be highlighted.
A correct letter in the wrong position will also be indicated.
Use the feedback to adjust your next guess.
You have six attempts to guess the correct word.

Requirements
Python 3.x
